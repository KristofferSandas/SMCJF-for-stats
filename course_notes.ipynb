If you were to simply sum up the deviations without squaring them, the positive and negative deviations would cancel each other out. This would result in a net deviation of zero, which does not reflect the actual spread or variability in the data. By squaring the differences, all deviations become positive values, preserving the magnitude of the deviations and ensuring that they contribute to the measure of variability.\n",

    "To emphasize larger deviations: Squaring the differences magnifies the impact of larger deviations from the mean. This is important because larger deviations are generally considered to have a greater influence on the overall variability of the dataset. By squaring the differences, you give more weight to these larger deviations, providing a more meaningful representation of the data spread and allowing the SD to be more sensitive to extreme values."
